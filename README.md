# EDMS

This is a java swing application that was created for the fictitious company Heli Vision as an electronic document management project in a helicopter service.

This is result of my independent process of learning the Java programming language and Swing.

## Application development

I spent a full 6 months on this project in 2015 . Netbeans ide development environment was used and for Data Base used SQLite.
